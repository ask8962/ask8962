# Hi, I'm Anukalp Gupta 👋

### 🚀 Java Developer | Product Engineer | Rapid Prototyper

I am a **Systems-First Engineer** focused on solving logic problems with **Java** and shipping full-stack products using **AI-augmented workflows**. I believe in "Shipping over Perfecting" for products, and "Depth over Breadth" for algorithms.

---

## 👨‍💻 What I Actually Do

- **Core Engineering:** I solve complex algorithmic problems and build robust logic using **Java** (Data Structures & Algorithms).
- **Product Development:** I use modern **AI-native tooling** (Cursor, v0, Firebase) to accelerate frontend delivery and deploy real, usable applications.
- **Consistency:** I commit code daily, solving LeetCode problems to sharpen my problem-solving intuition.
